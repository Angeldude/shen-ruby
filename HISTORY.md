# ShenRuby Release History

## Not Yet Released
### Features
- Graceful handling of Control-C in ShenRuby REPL [Bruno Deferrari]
- Handle `do` in the K Lambda compiler so that it is eligible for tail call elimination [Bruno Deferrari]
- Ruby->Shen interop
  - Shen functions can now be called from Ruby by invoking the corresponding method on the `ShenRuby::Shen` instance
  - Ruby arrays are coerced back and forth to K Lambda lists
  - Underscores in Ruby symbols are coerced back and forth to hyphens in Shen symbols

### Optimizations
Compared to ShenRuby 0.1.0, 50% faster Shen REPL launch and 38% faster execution of the Shen Test Suite achieved by:
- Faster application of K Lambda primitives when not partially applied
- Inlining of list primitives when not partially applied

### Bug Fixes
- [Issue 4](https://github.com/gregspurrier/shen-ruby/issues/4) -- `and` and `or` may now be partially applied
- [Issue 5](https://github.com/gregspurrier/shen-ruby/issues/4) -- the error raised by applying too many arguments to a function is now caught by `trap-error`.
